                    I am 20 years old. I enjoy playing video games and was a commpetitive swimmer in high school. 
                    I started coding in Python as a junior in high school. I found it interesting, but not something I saw myself 
                    doing for a career. I graduated high school in 2020 right at the start of the pandemic. I went to Utah 
                    State University that same year. During my first semester I struggled with all my classes because I lacked engagement with my online 
                    courses. At the time, there were many strick COVID-19 regulations which left me feeling isolated. 
                    This experience made me realize that I need in person classes or at least live Zoom classes to help me learn and stay engaged. 
                    In the middle of my second semester at USU, I placed a hold on my USU classes because I became depressed and had a lot of anxiety related to school.
                    I moved back home and I started debating about my future outlook. I started looking into coding again 
                    because my uncle had completed a different boot camp. That is when I enrolled in the Universty of Utah boot camp. I have 
                    enjoyed the program so far and am looking forward to my career.
